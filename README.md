UFLDL Tutorial in Julia

## Notes
I'm trying to do the UFLDL (Deep Learning) Tutorial in Julia. Hence I'm translating the excercises to Julia. As I'm not so experienced with Julia nor Deep Learning I'm always glad about notes and comments, pull requests and issues.

The excercise templates can be found in the `master` branch, while the solutions can be found in the `solutions` branch.

## Status Quo
Currently the first excercise (Linear Regression: 1A) is done. I'm not confident with the solution as the square-mean-error is nowhere near the expected 4-5 but more like 17-500 (maybe it's a scaling problem?). The plot looks fine though.

## Disclaimer
No guarantee for correctness whatsoever.
